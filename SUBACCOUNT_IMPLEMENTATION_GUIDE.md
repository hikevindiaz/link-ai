# Subaccount Implementation Guide

## ✅ The Solution is Now Live!

The system now **automatically** uses the correct auth token based on the phone number. No more manual environment variable changes!

## How It Works

1. When a call comes in, the system looks up the phone number in the database
2. If the phone has a `subaccountAuthToken`, it uses that for validation
3. If not, it falls back to the main account token
4. **Completely automatic** - each phone number can have its own auth token

## Setting Up Your Phone Number

### Option 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run update-phone-token
```

This will:
- List all your phone numbers
- Let you select which one to update
- Guide you through getting the subaccount auth token
- Update the database automatically

### Option 2: Direct Database Update
If you prefer SQL, use this query:

```sql
UPDATE "twilio_phone_numbers"
SET 
  "subaccountAuthToken" = 'YOUR_SUBACCOUNT_AUTH_TOKEN',
  "subaccountSid" = 'YOUR_SUBACCOUNT_SID' -- Optional
WHERE 
  "phoneNumber" = '+17874764102';
```

### Option 3: Programmatic Update
In your application code when purchasing/assigning numbers:

```typescript
await prisma.twilioPhoneNumber.update({
  where: { phoneNumber: '+17874764102' },
  data: {
    subaccountAuthToken: 'auth_token_from_subaccount',
    subaccountSid: 'AC...' // Optional
  }
});
```

## Getting the Subaccount Auth Token

1. Log into [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. **Switch to the subaccount** that owns the phone number
3. Go to **Account → API keys & tokens**
4. Copy the **Auth Token**
5. Use one of the methods above to save it

## Deploy and Test

1. Deploy the updated code:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Update your phone number with the subaccount token (using any method above)

3. Make a test call - it should work automatically!

## What Changed

### Before (❌ Manual)
- One global auth token for all phone numbers
- Had to manually change environment variables
- Couldn't support multiple Twilio accounts

### After (✅ Automatic)
- Each phone number can have its own auth token
- System automatically uses the correct token
- Supports unlimited Twilio accounts/subaccounts
- No manual intervention needed

## Future Enhancements

When adding new phone numbers through your UI:
1. Detect if it's from a subaccount
2. Prompt for the subaccount auth token
3. Save it with the phone number
4. Everything works automatically

## Security Note

In production, consider encrypting the `subaccountAuthToken` field since it's sensitive. You can use a library like `bcrypt` or AWS KMS for encryption at rest.
