# Phase 1 Complete: Unified Agent Runtime ✅

## 🎉 What We've Built

We've successfully created the **core foundation** of your Unified Agent Runtime that will power all your agent interactions across every channel. This is the "brain" that ensures consistent behavior whether someone is chatting on your website, calling on the phone, or messaging via WhatsApp.

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Unified Processing**
- Single runtime handles ALL channels (web, voice, phone, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Channel capabilities determine behavior (audio support, rich text, etc.)
- Consistent conversation management across all touchpoints

### 2. **Database Integration**
- System prompts come from `chatbot.prompt` field
- All settings loaded from your existing Chatbot model
- Messages saved to your existing Message table
- Full compatibility with your current schema

### 3. **Built-in Intelligence**
- Function calling support with built-in tools
- Streaming responses for real-time interactions
- Conversation history management
- Interruption handling for voice channels

### 4. **Channel Awareness**
- Each channel has defined capabilities
- Runtime adapts behavior based on channel
- Supports channel-specific overrides

## 🧪 How to Test Phase 1

### Step 1: Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Get a Chatbot ID
First, find one of your existing chatbots:
```sql
-- Run this in your database
SELECT id, name FROM chatbots LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 3: Test via cURL
Replace `[your-chatbot-id]` with an actual ID from your database:

```bash
# Basic test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-runtime/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello, how are you?",
    "chatbotId": "[your-chatbot-id]",
    "threadId": "test-123",
    "channelType": "web"
  }'

# Test function calling
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-runtime/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What time is it in Tokyo?",
    "chatbotId": "[your-chatbot-id]",
    "threadId": "test-456",
    "channelType": "web"
  }'

# Test different channel
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-runtime/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Can you help me?",
    "chatbotId": "[your-chatbot-id]",
    "threadId": "test-789",
    "channelType": "whatsapp"
  }'
```

### Step 4: Test Conversation Continuity
Send multiple messages with the same `threadId`:

```bash
# Message 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-runtime/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]" \
  -d '{
    "message": "My name is Sarah",
    "chatbotId": "[your-chatbot-id]",
    "threadId": "conversation-001",
    "channelType": "web"
  }'

# Message 2 (should remember the name)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-runtime/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What is my name?",
    "chatbotId": "[your-chatbot-id]",
    "threadId": "conversation-001",
    "channelType": "web"
  }'
```

## 📊 Expected Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": {
    "content": "Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?",
    "type": "text",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T12:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "debug": {
    "channelType": "web",
    "sessionId": "web-test-123",
    "messageCount": 2,
    "capabilities": {
      "supportsAudio": false,
      "supportsImages": true,
      "supportsRichText": true,
      "supportsFiles": true,
      "supportsTypingIndicator": true,
      "supportsDeliveryReceipts": false,
      "supportsInterruption": false,
      "maxMessageLength": 4000
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Unified message processing** - Same code handles all channels
2. **Conversation history** - Messages are saved and loaded correctly
3. **Function calling** - Built-in tools for time and calculations
4. **Channel capabilities** - Different behaviors for different channels
5. **Database integration** - Uses your existing schema
6. **Streaming support** - Ready for real-time responses
7. **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks and error messages

## 🔍 Verify in Your Database

After testing, check that messages are being saved:

```sql
-- Check recent messages
SELECT * FROM messages 
WHERE thread_id LIKE 'test-%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check specific conversation
SELECT message, response, created_at 
FROM messages 
WHERE thread_id = 'conversation-001' 
ORDER BY created_at;
```

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2?

Phase 1 provides the solid foundation. When you're ready, Phase 2 will add:
- Real-time phone integration with OpenAI Realtime API
- WebSocket support for Twilio Media Streams
- Better turn dynamics and interruption handling
- Audio streaming capabilities

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **System Prompt Location**: Edit the `prompt` field in your chatbots table
2. **Enable Channels**: Set `websiteEnabled`, `whatsappEnabled`, etc. to true
3. **Debug Logs**: Check console output with logger module enabled
4. **Test Tools**: Try "What's 25 * 4?" or "What time is it in London?"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. Ensure you're logged in (have a valid session)
2. Check the chatbot ID exists in your database
3. Verify your OpenAI API key is set in environment variables
4. Look at server logs for detailed error messages

**Phase 1 is complete!** You now have a unified runtime that can handle agents across all channels. Test it thoroughly, and when you're satisfied, we can move on to Phase 2 for real-time phone integration! 🎊
