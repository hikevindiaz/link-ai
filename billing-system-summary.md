# 🎉 Complete Billing System Implementation for LinkAI

## 📋 Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive billing system for LinkAI based on your pricing strategy. Here's what has been built:

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

1. **✅ New Subscription Plans (Starter, Growth, Scale)**
2. **✅ Usage Tracking & Overage Billing**
3. **✅ Dynamic Phone Number Pricing (existing + enhanced)**
4. **✅ Add-on System for Future Integrations**
5. **✅ Real-time Usage Dashboard**
6. **✅ Automated Overage Processing**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components Created

#### 1. **Subscription Configuration** (`config/subscriptions.ts`)
```typescript
// New pricing plans with usage limits and overage pricing
- Starter Plan: $69/month (1 agent, 2K messages, 50 SMS, etc.)
- Growth Plan: $199/month (5 agents, 12K messages, 150 SMS, etc.)
- Scale Plan: $499/month (10 agents, 25K messages, 400 SMS, etc.)

// Each plan includes:
- Feature limits per billing cycle
- Overage pricing per unit when limits exceeded
- Support levels and branding options
```

#### 2. **Usage Tracking System** (`lib/usage-tracking.ts`)
```typescript
// Comprehensive tracking for all billable metrics
- trackUsage() - Record usage events
- getUsageSummary() - Calculate current usage & overages
- processOverageCharges() - Automated billing at period end
- checkUsageLimit() - Real-time limit validation

// Usage Types Tracked:
- Messages, SMS, Web Searches
- Conversation Summaries, WhatsApp, Voice Minutes
```

#### 3. **Stripe Integration** (`scripts/setup-stripe-billing.js`)
```bash
# Created in Stripe:
✅ 3 Base subscription products & prices
✅ 18 Overage pricing tiers (6 features × 3 plans)
✅ 5 Add-on products for future integrations
📊 Total: 26 Stripe prices created
```

#### 4. **API Endpoints**
- `/api/billing/usage` - Track usage & get summaries
- `/api/billing/process-overages` - Automated overage processing
- `/api/stripe/subscription-items` - Manage subscription add-ons

#### 5. **Usage Dashboard** (`components/billing/usage-dashboard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Real-time dashboard showing:
- Current usage vs limits for all features
- Overage costs and billing period info
- Visual progress bars and utilization percentages
- Detailed breakdown tables
```

#### 6. **Database Schema** (Prisma)
```sql
-- New UsageRecord table for tracking
CREATE TABLE usage_records (
  id, userId, usageType, quantity,
  billingPeriodStart, billingPeriodEnd,
  metadata, createdAt
);
-- Indexed for fast queries
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables Added

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Base Subscription Plans
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID=price_1RUDYnBMnxCzo29MYxGrDWG7
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_GROWTH_PRICE_ID=price_1RUDYoBMnxCzo29MXVYvVNNv
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SCALE_PRICE_ID=price_1RUDYpBMnxCzo29MpWmyrw6f

# Optional: For overage processing automation
CRON_SECRET_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-email@example.com,admin@getlinkai.com
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Subscription Flow**
```mermaid
User selects plan → Stripe checkout → Base subscription created → Usage tracking begins
```

### 2. **Usage Tracking Flow**
```mermaid
Feature used → trackUsage() called → Usage recorded in database → Real-time dashboard updated
```

### 3. **Overage Billing Flow**
```mermaid
End of billing period → processOverageCharges() → Calculate overages → Create Stripe invoice items → User charged
```

### 4. **Phone Number Flow (Enhanced)**
```mermaid
User buys phone → Dynamic pricing calculated → Added as subscription item → Monthly billing
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

### In Your Existing Code

To start tracking usage, add these calls in your application:

```typescript
import { trackMessage, trackSMS, trackWebSearch } from '@/lib/usage-tracking';

// When a message is sent
await trackMessage(userId, chatbotId);

// When SMS is sent/received
await trackSMS(userId, phoneNumber, 'outbound');

// When web search is performed
await trackWebSearch(userId, searchQuery, chatbotId);

// etc.
```

### Automatic Overage Processing

Set up a cron job to process overages monthly:

```bash
# Call this at the end of each billing period
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/billing/process-overages \
  -H "x-cron-token: your_secret_token"
```
