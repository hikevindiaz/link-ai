Based on our recent work, here's a summary of our agent approach:
API Integration
Successfully migrated to OpenAI's Responses API
Implemented proper streaming response handling
Configured file search and web search capabilities
Used correct parameters: instructions instead of system_prompt, max_output_tokens instead of max_tokens
Architecture
Used Vercel AI SDK with streamProtocol: 'text' for client-side handling
Implemented server-side streaming with proper chunk handling
Integrated vector stores for knowledge base search
Maintained compatibility with both file search and web search tools
Key Components
Chat Interface (components/chat-interface/chat.tsx)
API Route Handler (app/api/chat-interface/route.ts)
Knowledge Base Integration (components/knowledge-base/source-settings.tsx)
Vector Store Configuration for file search
Response Handling
// Key streaming implementation
if (chunk.type === 'response.output_text.delta') {
  if (typeof chunk.delta === 'string') {
    controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(chunk.delta));
  } 
  else if (chunk.delta && typeof chunk.delta.text === 'string') {
    controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(chunk.delta.text));
  }
}
Best Practices
Proper error handling and logging
Clean separation of concerns between client and server
Efficient streaming response processing
Proper type checking and fallbacks
This approach successfully combines OpenAI's latest APIs with file search capabilities while maintaining efficient streaming responses for a smooth user experience.
