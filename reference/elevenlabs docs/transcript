Headers
xi-api-key
string
Required
Query parameters
enable_logging
boolean
Optional
Defaults to true
When enable_logging is set to false zero retention mode will be used for the request. This will mean history features are unavailable for this request, including request stitching. Zero retention mode may only be used by enterprise customers.

Request
This endpoint expects a multipart form containing a file.
model_id
string
Required
The ID of the model to use for transcription, currently only ‘scribe_v1’ and ‘scribe_v1_experimental’ are available.

file
file
Required
The file to transcribe. All major audio and video formats are supported. The file size must be less than 1GB.

language_code
string
Optional
An ISO-639-1 or ISO-639-3 language_code corresponding to the language of the audio file. Can sometimes improve transcription performance if known beforehand. Defaults to null, in this case the language is predicted automatically.

tag_audio_events
boolean
Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to tag audio events like (laughter), (footsteps), etc. in the transcription.

num_speakers
integer
Optional
>=1
<=32
The maximum amount of speakers talking in the uploaded file. Can help with predicting who speaks when. The maximum amount of speakers that can be predicted is 32. Defaults to null, in this case the amount of speakers is set to the maximum value the model supports.

timestamps_granularity
enum
Optional
Defaults to word
The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription. ‘word’ provides word-level timestamps and ‘character’ provides character-level timestamps per word.

Allowed values:
none
word
character
diarize
boolean
Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to annotate which speaker is currently talking in the uploaded file.

additional_formats

file_format
enum
Optional
Defaults to other
The format of input audio. Options are ‘pcm_s16le_16’ or ‘other’ For pcm_s16le_16, the input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 16kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order. Latency will be lower than with passing an encoded waveform.

Allowed values:
pcm_s16le_16
other
