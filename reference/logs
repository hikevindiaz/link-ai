Text generation and prompting
=============================

Learn how to prompt a model to generate text.

With the OpenAI API, you can use a [large language model](/docs/models) to generate text from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). Models can generate almost any kind of text response—like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Here's a simple example using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses).

Generate text from a simple prompt

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

An array of content generated by the model is in the `output` property of the response. In this simple example, we have just one output which looks like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "msg_67b73f697ba4819183a15cc17d011509",
        "type": "message",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "Under the soft glow of the moon, Luna the unicorn danced through fields of twinkling stardust, leaving trails of dreams for every child asleep.",
                "annotations": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Note that the output often has more than one item!

**The `output` array often has more than one item in it!** It can contain tool calls, data about reasoning tokens generated by [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning), and other items. It is not safe to assume that the model's text output is present at `output[0].content[0].text`.

Some of our [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) include an `output_text` property on model responses for convenience, which aggregates all text outputs from the model into a single string. This may be useful as a shortcut to access text output from the model.

In addition to plain text, you can also have the model return structured data in JSON format - this feature is called [**Structured Outputs**](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Message roles and instruction following
---------------------------------------

You can provide instructions to the model with [differing levels of authority](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) using the `instructions` API parameter or **message roles**.

The `instructions` parameter gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt in the `input` parameter.

Generate text with instructions

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    instructions: "Talk like a pirate.",
    input: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="Talk like a pirate.",
    input="Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "instructions": "Talk like a pirate.",
        "input": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
    }'
```

The example above is roughly equivalent to using the following input messages in the `input` array:

Generate text with messages using different roles

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    input: [
        {
            role: "developer",
            content: "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "developer",
                "content": "Talk like a pirate."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

Instructions versus developer messages in multi-turn conversations

Note that the `instructions` parameter only applies to the current response generation request. If you are [managing conversation state](/docs/guides/conversation-state) with the `previous_response_id` parameter, the `instructions` used on previous turns will not be present in the context. If you'd like to persist the same model instructions across turns, use a `developer` message instead.

The [OpenAI model spec](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) describes how our models give different levels of priority to messages with different roles.

|developer|user|assistant|
|---|---|---|
|developer messages are instructions provided by the application developer, weighted ahead of user messages.|user messages are instructions provided by an end user, weighted behind developer messages.|Messages generated by the model have the assistant role.|

A multi-turn conversation may consist of several messages of these types, along with other content types provided by both you and the model. Learn more about [managing conversation state here](/docs/guides/conversation-state).

Choosing a model
----------------

A key choice to make when generating content through the API is which model you want to use - the `model` parameter of the code samples above. [You can find a full listing of available models here](/docs/models).

### Which model should I choose?

Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a model for text generation.

*   **[Reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning)** generate an internal chain of thought to analyze the input prompt, and excel at understanding complex tasks and multi-step planning. They are also generally slower and more expensive to use than GPT models.
*   **GPT models** are fast, cost-efficient, and highly intelligent, but benefit from more explicit instructions around how to accomplish tasks.
*   **Large and small (mini) models** offer trade-offs for speed, cost, and intelligence. Large models are more effective at understanding prompts and solving problems across domains, while small models are generally faster and cheaper to use. Small models like GPT-4o mini can also be trained to excel at a specific task through [fine tuning](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) and [distillation](/docs/guides/distillation) of results from larger models.

When in doubt, `gpt-4o` offers a solid combination of intelligence, speed, and cost effectiveness.

Prompt engineering
------------------

Creating effective instructions for a model to generate content is a process known as **prompt engineering**. Because the content generated from a model is non-deterministic, it is a combination of art and science to build a prompt that will generate the right kind of content from a model. You can find a more complete exploration of [prompt engineering here](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering), but here are some general guidelines:

*   Be detailed in your instructions to the model to eliminate ambiguity in how you want the model to respond.
*   Provide examples to the model of the type of inputs you expect, and the type of outputs you would want for that input - this technique is called **few-shot learning**.
*   When using a [reasoning model](/docs/guides/reasoning), describe the task to be done in terms of goals and desired outcomes, rather than specific step-by-step instructions of how to accomplish a task.
*   Invest in creating [evaluations (evals)](/docs/guides/evals) for your prompts, using test data that looks like the data you expect to see in production. Due to the inherent variable results from different models, using evals to see how your prompts perform is the best way to ensure your prompts work as expected.

Iterating on prompts is often all you need to do to get great results from a model, but you can also explore [fine tuning](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) to customize base models for a particular use case.

Built-in tools
==============

Use built-in tools like web search and file search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend model capabilities using built-in **tools**. These tools help models access additional context and information from the web or your files. The example below uses the [web search tool](/docs/guides/tools-web-search) to use the latest information from the web to generate a model response.

Include web search results for the model response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

Available tools
---------------

Here's an overview of the tools available in the OpenAI platform—select one of them for further guidance on usage.

[

Web search

Include data from the Internet in model response generation.

](/docs/guides/tools-web-search)[

File search

Search the contents of uploaded files for context when generating a response.

](/docs/guides/tools-file-search)[

Computer use

Create agentic workflows that enable a model to control a computer interface.

](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)[

Function calling

Enable the model to call custom code that you define, giving it access to additional data and capabilities.

](/docs/guides/function-calling)

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [model response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), you can enable tool access by specifying configurations in the `tools` parameter. Each tool has its own unique configuration requirements—see the [Available tools](#available-tools) section for detailed instructions.

Based on the provided [prompt](/docs/guides/text), the model automatically decides whether to use a configured tool. For instance, if your prompt requests information beyond the model's training cutoff date and web search is enabled, the model will typically invoke the web search tool to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information.

You can explicitly control or guide this behavior by setting the `tool_choice` parameter [in the API request](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).

Web search
==========

Allow models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.

Using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), you can enable web search by configuring it in the `tools` array in an API request to generate content. Like any other tool, the model can choose to search the web or not based on the content of the input prompt.

Web search tool example

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

Web search tool versions

The current default version of the web search tool is:

`web_search_preview`

Which points to a dated version:

`web_search_preview_2025_03_11`

As the tool evolves, future dated snapshot versions will be documented in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

You can also force the use of the `web_search_preview` tool by using the `tool_choice` parameter, and setting it to `{type: "web_search_preview"}` - this can help ensure lower latency and more consistent results.

Output and citations
--------------------

Model responses that use the web search tool will include two parts:

*   A `web_search_call` output item with the ID of the search call.
*   A `message` output item containing:
    *   The text result in `message.content[0].text`
    *   Annotations `message.content[0].annotations` for the cited URLs

By default, the model's response will include inline citations for URLs found in the web search results. In addition to this, the `url_citation` annotation object will contain the URL, title and location of the cited source.

When displaying web results or information contained in web results to end users, inline citations must be made clearly visible and clickable in your user interface.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "web_search_call",
    "id": "ws_67c9fa0502748190b7dd390736892e100be649c1a5ff9609",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  {
    "id": "msg_67c9fa077e288190af08fdffda2e34f20be649c1a5ff9609",
    "type": "message",
    "status": "completed",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "output_text",
        "text": "On March 6, 2025, several news...",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "type": "url_citation",
            "start_index": 2606,
            "end_index": 2758,
            "url": "https://...",
            "title": "Title..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

User location
-------------

To refine search results based on geography, you can specify an approximate user location using country, city, region, and/or timezone.

*   The `city` and `region` fields are free text strings, like `Minneapolis` and `Minnesota` respectively.
*   The `country` field is a two-letter [ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1), like `US`.
*   The `timezone` field is an [IANA timezone](https://timeapi.io/documentation/iana-timezones) like `America/Chicago`.

Customizing user location

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "user_location": {
            "type": "approximate",
            "country": "GB",
            "city": "London",
            "region": "London",
        }
    }],
    input="What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        user_location: {
            type: "approximate",
            country: "GB",
            city: "London",
            region: "London"
        }
    }],
    input: "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "user_location": {
                "type": "approximate",
                "country": "GB",
                "city": "London",
                "region": "London"
            }
        }],
        "input": "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?"
    }'
```

Search context size
-------------------

When using this tool, the `search_context_size` parameter controls how much context is retrieved from the web to help the tool formulate a response. The tokens used by the search tool do **not** affect the context window of the main model specified in the `model` parameter in your response creation request. These tokens are also **not** carried over from one turn to another — they're simply used to formulate the tool response and then discarded.

Choosing a context size impacts:

*   **Cost**: Pricing of our search tool varies based on the value of this parameter. Higher context sizes are more expensive. See tool pricing [here](/docs/pricing).
*   **Quality**: Higher search context sizes generally provide richer context, resulting in more accurate, comprehensive answers.
*   **Latency**: Higher context sizes require processing more tokens, which can slow down the tool's response time.

Available values:

*   **`high`**: Most comprehensive context, highest cost, slower response.
*   **`medium`** (default): Balanced context, cost, and latency.
*   **`low`**: Least context, lowest cost, fastest response, but potentially lower answer quality.

Again, tokens used by the search tool do **not** impact main model's token usage and are not carried over from turn to turn. Check the [pricing page](/docs/pricing) for details on costs associated with each context size.

Customizing search context size

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "search_context_size": "low",
    }],
    input="What movie won best picture in 2025?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        search_context_size: "low",
    }],
    input: "What movie won best picture in 2025?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "search_context_size": "low"
        }],
        "input": "What movie won best picture in 2025?"
    }'
```

Limitations
-----------

Below are a few notable implementation considerations when using web search.

*   The [`gpt-4o-search-preview`](/docs/models/gpt-4o-search-preview) and [`gpt-4o-mini-search-preview`](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-search-preview) models used in Chat Completions only support a subset of API parameters - view their model data pages for specific information on rate limits and feature support.
*   When used as a tool in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), web search has the same tiered rate limits as the models above.
*   [Refer to this guide](/docs/guides/your-data) for data handling, residency, and retention information.

File search
===========

Allow models to search your files for relevant information before generating a response.

Overview
--------

File search is a tool available in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses). It enables models to retrieve information in a knowledge base of previously uploaded files through semantic and keyword search. By creating vector stores and uploading files to them, you can augment the models' inherent knowledge by giving them access to these knowledge bases or `vector_stores`.

To learn more about how vector stores and semantic search work, refer to our [retrieval guide](/docs/guides/retrieval).

This is a hosted tool managed by OpenAI, meaning you don't have to implement code on your end to handle its execution. When the model decides to use it, it will automatically call the tool, retrieve information from your files, and return an output.

How to use
----------

Prior to using file search with the Responses API, you need to have set up a knowledge base in a vector store and uploaded files to it.

Create a vector store and upload a file

Follow these steps to create a vector store and upload a file to it. You can use [this example file](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf) or upload your own.

#### Upload the file to the File API

Upload a file

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def create_file(client, file_path):
    if file_path.startswith("http://") or file_path.startswith("https://"):
        # Download the file content from the URL
        response = requests.get(file_path)
        file_content = BytesIO(response.content)
        file_name = file_path.split("/")[-1]
        file_tuple = (file_name, file_content)
        result = client.files.create(
            file=file_tuple,
            purpose="assistants"
        )
    else:
        # Handle local file path
        with open(file_path, "rb") as file_content:
            result = client.files.create(
                file=file_content,
                purpose="assistants"
            )
    print(result.id)
    return result.id

# Replace with your own file path or URL
file_id = create_file(client, "https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf")
```

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

async function createFile(filePath) {
  let result;
  if (filePath.startsWith("http://") || filePath.startsWith("https://")) {
    // Download the file content from the URL
    const res = await fetch(filePath);
    const buffer = await res.arrayBuffer();
    const urlParts = filePath.split("/");
    const fileName = urlParts[urlParts.length - 1];
    const file = new File([buffer], fileName);
    result = await openai.files.create({
      file: file,
      purpose: "assistants",
    });
  } else {
    // Handle local file path
    const fileContent = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
    result = await openai.files.create({
      file: fileContent,
      purpose: "assistants",
    });
  }
  return result.id;
}

// Replace with your own file path or URL
const fileId = await createFile(
  "https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf"
);

console.log(fileId);
```

#### Create a vector store

Create a vector store

```python
vector_store = client.vector_stores.create(
    name="knowledge_base"
)
print(vector_store.id)
```

```javascript
const vectorStore = await openai.vectorStores.create({
    name: "knowledge_base",
});
console.log(vectorStore.id);
```

#### Add the file to the vector store

Add a file to a vector store

```python
client.vector_stores.files.create(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    file_id=file_id
)
print(result)
```

```javascript
await openai.vectorStores.files.create(
    vectorStore.id,
    {
        file_id: fileId,
    }
});
```

#### Check status

Run this code until the file is ready to be used (i.e., when the status is `completed`).

Check status

```python
result = client.vector_stores.files.list(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id
)
print(result)
```

```javascript
const result = await openai.vectorStores.files.list({
    vector_store_id: vectorStore.id,
});
console.log(result);
```

Once your knowledge base is set up, you can include the `file_search` tool in the list of tools available to the model, along with the list of vector stores in which to search.

At the moment, you can search in only one vector store at a time, so you can include only one vector store ID when calling the file search tool.

File search tool

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
    }],
});
console.log(response);
```

When this tool is called by the model, you will receive a response with multiple outputs:

1.  A `file_search_call` output item, which contains the id of the file search call.
2.  A `message` output item, which contains the response from the model, along with the file citations.

              "filename": "deep_research_blog.pdf"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Retrieval customization
-----------------------

### Limiting the number of results

Using the file search tool with the Responses API, you can customize the number of results you want to retrieve from the vector stores. This can help reduce both token usage and latency, but may come at the cost of reduced answer quality.

Limit the number of results

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"],
        "max_num_results": 2
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
        max_num_results: 2,
    }],
});
console.log(response);
```

### Include search results in the response

While you can see annotations (references to files) in the output text, the file search call will not return search results by default.

To include search results in the response, you can use the `include` parameter when creating the response.

Include search results

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }],
    include=["file_search_call.results"]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
    }],
    include: ["file_search_call.results"],
});
console.log(response);
```

### Metadata filtering

You can filter the search results based on the metadata of the files. For more details, refer to our [retrieval guide](/docs/guides/retrieval), which covers:

*   How to [set attributes on vector store files](/docs/guides/retrieval#attributes)
*   How to [define filters](/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering)

Metadata filtering

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"],
        "filters": {
            "type": "eq",
            "key": "type",
            "value": "blog"
        }
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
        filters: {
            type: "eq",
            key: "type",
            value: "blog"
        }
    }]
});
console.log(response);
```
