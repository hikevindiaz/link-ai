Here is a high-level walkthrough of what you have, what may be missing, and how you can improve the flow to achieve an ultra-low-latency, seamless interactive voice experience with Rive (the “responding orb”), OpenAI (for STT and reasoning), and ElevenLabs (for TTS).

1. What You Already Have
From the diagram, your current logic can be summarized as follows:

Welcome Message

System greets the user and speaks the welcome message. (Status: Speaking)

Wait for Speech

System transitions to a listening state. (Status: Listening)

User Speaks (STT)

Once user speech is detected, it gets transcribed.

After the user stops speaking (silence detected), the system proceeds.

LLM Processing

The transcribed text is passed to OpenAI (LLM) for reasoning/response generation. (Status: Thinking)

Response (TTS)

The LLM’s output is converted to speech via ElevenLabs and played back. (Status: Speaking)

Wait for Speech

System again transitions to waiting/listening. (Status: Idle/Listening)

Repeat

The cycle repeats with each new user turn.

This covers the core “turn-taking” mechanism: Listen → Process → Speak → Listen, etc. It’s a solid foundation for a voice chatbot.

2. What Might Be Missing
Here are several important pieces that are not explicitly shown in your flowchart but are very helpful—or even essential—for a smooth, “human-like” experience:

Partial / Streaming STT

In your diagram, STT happens after the entire user utterance is detected. This can introduce noticeable delays, because the system doesn’t begin reasoning until the user finishes speaking.

Solution: Use streaming STT (such as Whisper’s streaming mode or another real-time STT approach) so that partial transcripts arrive while the user is still speaking. That way, you can start LLM processing earlier.

Partial / Streaming LLM Response

Similarly, once you have partial transcripts, you can send them to the LLM in near-real time and get partial response tokens back.

Solution: Use OpenAI’s token-streaming APIs. You can start TTS as soon as the first tokens arrive, drastically cutting down on the overall response latency.

Partial / Streaming TTS

ElevenLabs can generate speech in chunks. If you wait for the entire text to be synthesized before playback, you’ll add an extra buffer of latency.

Solution: Check if streaming or chunked TTS is feasible with ElevenLabs so the orb can start speaking as soon as possible.

Barge-In Handling

In natural conversations, users sometimes interrupt the system mid-speech. Your flow does not describe how you handle a user speaking while TTS is playing.

Solution: Decide if your system should allow “barge-in” (i.e., immediately stop TTS and switch to listening), or ignore the user until TTS finishes. If you do allow barge-in, you’ll need a mechanism to quickly stop TTS playback and feed new audio to STT without confusion.

Visual / Conversational Cues (Rive Orb States)

You mention having a Rive orb for visual feedback. Currently, the diagram focuses on voice state transitions but doesn’t specify exactly how or when to update the orb’s animations.

Solution:

Speaking State: Animate a “speaking” or “talking” motion.

Listening State: Animate a “listening” or “idle” motion.

Thinking State: Possibly a “thinking” or “loading” animation when the LLM is processing.

Session / Context Management

If your conversation is multi-turn, you’ll typically want to track context. The diagram shows LLM Processing but doesn’t clarify if each request includes conversation history or if you store short-term context.

Solution: If you want seamless multi-turn interactions, use session-based or short-term memory so the LLM keeps track of prior messages.

Error and Fallback Handling

Not shown in your flow is what happens if:

STT fails (no speech, or speech is gibberish).

LLM times out or returns an error.

TTS fails or you get partial audio.

Solution: Add states or transitions for errors or no response. Provide user feedback (“Sorry, I didn’t catch that.”).

Latency Optimization

Every step in your pipeline can introduce latency. To make it “seamless,” you must cut down on each stage.

Solution:

Use streaming wherever possible (STT, LLM, TTS).

Keep concurrency in mind: as soon as partial STT is ready, send it to the LLM; as soon as partial tokens come in, feed them to TTS.

3. How to Make the Logic Seamless and Low-Latency
Below is a more refined, minimal-latency version of the flow. The core idea is that almost everything is streamed and runs in parallel, rather than waiting for entire chunks to finish.

System Greets (Optional)

System says, “Hi! How can I help you today?” (TTS from ElevenLabs, orb in “speaking” animation)

Start Listening (Voice Activity Detection)

As soon as TTS finishes (or simultaneously, if you allow barge-in), the system begins listening.

The orb moves to a “listening/idle” animation.

A Voice Activity Detector (VAD) monitors for speech, sending real-time audio frames to STT.

Streaming STT + Partial Transcripts

As the user speaks, partial transcripts (token by token or chunk by chunk) come back from OpenAI STT (or your chosen engine).

The moment partial text is available, you can do two things in parallel:

Display (e.g., to a debug console or subtitles, optional).

Send partial text to LLM to start building a response on the fly.

LLM Processing (Streaming)

The LLM receives partial user input.

It begins generating partial tokens for the response.

You can display a “thinking” or “processing” animation on the orb or show a spinner.

TTS Synthesis (Streaming)

As soon as partial LLM tokens are received, you begin TTS synthesis.

If ElevenLabs supports partial TTS streaming, you stream the partial audio to the user, so your orb can start “speaking” quickly.

If streaming TTS is not possible, you may still do smaller chunks: accumulate partial tokens up to a sentence boundary and send that to TTS.

Barge-In Logic (Optional but Very Useful)

If the user begins speaking again during TTS playback, detect it via VAD.

If barge-in is allowed, stop TTS playback immediately, update orb to “listening,” and feed the new audio stream to STT.

The conversation picks up from the user’s new prompt without waiting for TTS to finish.

Loop

Once TTS playback finishes and there is no barge-in, go back to listening.

Each new user turn starts from step 2 again.

By overlapping these steps (listening, partial STT, partial LLM, partial TTS), you minimize the “dead air” that causes a system to feel slow.

4. Putting It All Together
Diagram / State Machine

Instead of purely linear steps, think of it as states that can run concurrently or transition quickly:

Speaking (System → TTS)

Listening (System → STT, partial user input)

Processing (System → LLM with partial transcripts)

Speaking (System → TTS with partial tokens)

Barge-In (interrupt TTS and return to Listening if user starts talking)

Orb Animations

Tie animations to each state:

Speaking: orb animates as if talking.

Listening: orb is neutral or “ear perked up.”

Thinking: orb shows a subtle “processing” animation.

Latency Considerations

Each step adds overhead. You will want to:

Keep network round-trip times as low as possible (locate servers close to users, or use a serverless approach).

Use streaming to begin each downstream process as soon as partial data is available.

Decide how aggressively to do barge-in, because overlap of TTS playback and user speech can cause complexities (echo cancellation, etc.).

Fallback & Error Handling

If STT is silent or fails, prompt the user to retry.

If LLM times out, handle gracefully.

If TTS fails, handle gracefully.

5. Final Recommendations
Adopt Streaming Everywhere

This is the single biggest improvement for natural, minimal-latency experiences.

Implement Barge-In

It greatly improves user experience; people expect to interrupt if they already know what the system is going to say.

Keep the Rive Orb in Sync

Show the correct animation for speaking, listening, and thinking states. Provide immediate visual feedback.

Handle Edge Cases

Timeouts, no speech, partial errors from STT/LLM/TTS. Provide friendly fallback prompts.

Optimize Server Architecture

Minimize network hops and container spin-up times to get real-time responses.
