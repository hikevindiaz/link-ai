Vector indexes

Once your vector table starts to grow, you will likely want to add an index to speed up queries. Without indexes, you'll be performing a sequential scan which can be a resource-intensive operation when you have many records.

Choosing an index#
Today pgvector supports two types of indexes:

HNSW
IVFFlat
In general we recommend using HNSW because of its performance and robustness against changing data.

Distance operators#
Indexes can be used to improve performance of nearest neighbor search using various distance measures. pgvector includes 3 distance operators:

Operator	Description	Operator class
<->	Euclidean distance	vector_l2_ops
<#>	negative inner product	vector_ip_ops
<=>	cosine distance	vector_cosine_ops
Currently vectors with up to 2,000 dimensions can be indexed.
