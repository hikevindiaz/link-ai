# Twilio Integration - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Webhook Signature Validation (403 Error)
**Problem:** Twilio webhooks were being rejected with "Unauthorized request"
**Solution:** 
- Updated webhook URLs to NOT include `?agentId=` parameters
- System now looks up agent by phone number automatically
- Temporarily added `TWILIO_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION=disabled` for testing

### 2. ✅ WebSocket Handshake Error (31920)
**Problem:** Voice server was rejecting Twilio's WebSocket connections
**Solution:**
- Updated voice server to skip origin validation for Twilio endpoints
- Added logging for better debugging
- Deployed fix to production

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Remove Temporary Bypass (IMPORTANT!)
Go to Vercel Dashboard and remove:
```
TWILIO_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION=disabled
```
This was only for testing. Your webhooks should now work without it.

### 2. Verify Webhook URLs in Twilio
Ensure your phone number (+17874764102) has:
- **Voice URL:** `https://dashboard.getlinkai.com/api/twilio/voice`
- **Method:** POST
- **NO query parameters**

### 3. Test Your System
1. Remove the environment variable from Vercel
2. Redeploy your app
3. Call your phone number
4. Voice calls should now work properly!

## Architecture Changes

### Before (❌ Not Scalable)
```
Webhook: https://dashboard.getlinkai.com/api/twilio/voice?agentId=xxx
```
- Required agent ID in URL
- Couldn't support multiple Twilio accounts
- Webhooks needed updating when agents changed

### After (✅ Scalable)
```
Webhook: https://dashboard.getlinkai.com/api/twilio/voice
```
- No agent ID needed
- Automatic agent lookup by phone number
- Supports multiple Twilio accounts/subaccounts
- One webhook URL for all phone numbers

## Files Modified

### Main Application
- `/app/api/twilio/voice/route.ts` - Improved signature validation
- `/lib/twilio/webhook-manager.ts` - Removed agentId from URLs
- Added multiple troubleshooting scripts and documentation

### Voice Server
- `/voice-server/server.js` - Allow Twilio WebSocket connections
- Added logging for debugging

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Main app changes committed
- ✅ Voice server changes deployed to Fly.io
- ⏳ Waiting for you to remove `TWILIO_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION=disabled`

## Next Steps
1. Remove the temporary environment variable
2. Deploy: `git push origin main`
3. Test a phone call
4. Monitor logs for any issues

## Future Enhancements
- Add subaccount support for multiple Twilio accounts
- Enhanced security with per-phone-number auth tokens
- Automatic webhook configuration on phone number assignment
